  		<h5 style="color:blue;">When: Celebrated in March</h5>

  			<p>Shigmotsav or Shigmo or Gulalotsav is a 14-day-long spring festival celebrated in Goa in March. It is the biggest spring festival celebrated by the Hindus and is a fusion of carnival and Holi. The festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Phalguna on the full moon day. Shigmotsav is Goa’s answer to the festival of colours, Holi.

          The celebration begins by offering prayers to the god and goddess of the village. During this festival, elaborate floats are prepared and parades with street dancers and traditional folk songs are organised. The floats usually display scenes from religious texts and regional mythology. These beautifully lit and artistically-designed floats are taken out in a parade in many places in the state like Panaji, Mapusa, Ponda and Madgao. Folk dances are performed by dance troupes on the road. The streets of Goa turn into cultural centre with music and dance.</p>  	</center>
